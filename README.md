# gitpullnode
A lot of beta projects are on Github and code changes in these projects are quite frequently observed.
The users of these projects/apps need to have a better way of knowing that their favorite
beta app on github has an update or the creators committed an important bug fix.

PS: I am working on my College Minor project and I was tired of telling my team mates to pull the code
each time I made any change. I wanted them to know it automatically whenever they used my code. So I built this.

# Install
`npm install --save gitpullnode`

# Use
`require('gitpullnode')();`

# Demo
